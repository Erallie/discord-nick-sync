# DiscordNickSync
DiscordNickSync is a plugin that lets your players sync their Discord nickname to their Essentials nickname, and vice versa, via [DiscordSRV](https://modrinth.com/plugin/discordsrv).

I know that DiscordSRV *already* allows syncing from Minecraft to Discord, but it doesn't allow syncing the other way around. So I created this plugin to do that!
