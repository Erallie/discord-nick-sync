DiscordNickSync is a plugin for Minecraft Java Edition that lets your players sync their Discord nickname to their Essentials nickname, and vice versa, via [DiscordSRV](https://modrinth.com/plugin/discordsrv).

I know that DiscordSRV *already* allows syncing from Minecraft to Discord, but it doesn't allow syncing the other way around. So I created this plugin to do that!

## When Nicknames are Synced
DiscordNickSync currently *only* syncs nicknames when a player does any of the following:
- Logs in
- Links their Discord to Minecraft via DiscordSRV
- Changes their Essentials nickname.
- Uses the command `/discordnick sync`

There is currently *no* timer to sync nicknames from Discord to Minecraft. If this is a feature you would want, [create an issue](https://github.com/Erallie/discord-nick-sync/issues), and I will consider adding it.
